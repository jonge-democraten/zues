Zues
====
Zues is a Django-based web application developed for the Jonge Democraten.
The JD regularly organizes political conferences. Members can send proposals
to the conference teams using this web application.

Special credits to Malu and Esmee for their excellent cooking skills which supported the development of this application and to the Jonge Democraten ICT-team for providing a productive environment. Also to Pieter for stopping me from adding too many complex features and keeping an eye on readable code. If you don't understand the code, it's not your fault, it's Pieter's!
